### AI-Powered Rural Sustainability & Decision Intelligence Platform

## Overview
GramSutra AI is an AI-driven platform designed to support rural ecosystems by helping
farmers and communities make sustainable, climate-aware, and resource-efficient decisions.
The system combines AI recommendations, sustainability scoring, and local-language
explanations to improve long-term rural livelihoods.

## Problem
Rural communities often lack access to localized, actionable intelligence for agriculture
and resource management. Existing solutions are generic, non-explainable, and focused on
short-term productivity rather than sustainability.
